# Rust Lessons Repository

This is where I store all the code I write as I read the Rust Book.

This project can be compiled and ran as a binary with optional menus
to run the code I've written for each lesson or practice project.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rmj1001/rust-book-lessons.git

cd rust-book-lessons

cargo run

```
